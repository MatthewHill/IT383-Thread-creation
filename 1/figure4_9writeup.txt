The purpose of this program is to find the sum of a number n with the numbers between 0 and n.
This program does this by creating threads. 
The parameter "sum" is shared by all threads so that it may be modified by each peice to form the final sum.
The first thing we do in main is define tid to be a thread identifier and attr to keep track of the thread attributes.
We then do some error checking: We check to make sure there are two arguments because this program will only take an integer value.
we also check that the value given by the user is either 0 or a positive number because our program does not work on negatives.
The program then sets our attributes for thread to a default value and creates the thread.  The thread runs a function that we define after main.
This function finds the sum of the values and then exits the thread.  Back in the main function, once the thread exits, main calls a join command that returns the thread
based on its identifier.  The program then prints out the sum.
